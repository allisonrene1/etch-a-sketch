# etch-a-sketch

This is maybe the 3rd project I've ever built by myself? Obvs no tutorial, just a ton of googling.
I know it looks like a nuclear bomb was dropped into the .js file, but at least it works, I guess.
Definitely needs to be refactored and could easily be condensed into something much cleaner and easier
to read. Anyways, I digress, it's an etch-a-sketch with a color mode button, an eraser button, and a button
to clear the entire sketch pad.
